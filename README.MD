# HOW TO USE THIS TUTORIAL

## 1
  - Read the [scss.md](https://github.com/Riley-I/SASS-tutorial/blob/master/scss.md) file for a brief introduction to SASS
 
## 2
   - Use the [run-book](https://github.com/Riley-I/SASS-tutorial/blob/master/run-book.md) to help you to setup and install SASS on the command line/terminal
   - there extensions to use to compile SASS but I won't cover those here

## 3
   - Once you have SASS installed, you can use the [tutorial.html](https://github.com/Riley-I/SASS-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.html) file and the CSS and SCSS files in the [SCSS directory](https://github.com/Riley-I/SASS-tutorial/tree/master/scss) to practice using SASS and watching the compiler run in your terminal
   
   *Enjoy!*
